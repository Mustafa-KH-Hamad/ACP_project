Salam Alaekum 
so this is a ACP Project (Advance computer programming) that is crerated by Mustafa Khalid - Balen Ibrahim - Muhammad Zyad 

this project is medical inventory management system (Madxal)

we did follow DR.Polla's requirement although our code is not the best but we gave all we could to build best project 

things to consider in this project 
1- note that there is a lot of duplicated code and we didnt had time to delete them 
2- at first we worked with objects then we found out we had to work with databases so there  is  alot of unnecessary objects 
3- as you can see we did not follow the MVC as it was required 
4- to use our project you should create a database as same name as we named our project so what is the name of the projcet database (wallahi i dont know !)


the project is not 100% completed 

finally you can ask any question ( if i remember any thing in this projcet )

**Inshalla you will do your Best**
